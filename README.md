# Hand Grinder Calibrator

![](./grinder-v1.png)

A browser-based tool for mapping grind settings between hand grinders. Dial in a click count on one grinder and see the equivalent setting on another, based on each grinder's microns-per-click and zero-offset values. Includes brew method presets (V60, Espresso, AeroPress, Moka, Chemex, French Press, Cold Brew) with highlighted recommended ranges and haptic-style click audio feedback.

## How the mapping works

Microns are the single source of truth. Each brew method has a recommended micron range, and every grinder's click range is derived from that range using its own µm-per-click and zero-offset values. Setting one grinder updates the other to the equivalent grind size in microns.

## Brew-method ranges source

Recommended ranges are based on the [Honest Coffee Guide](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/) charts for each grinder, expressed in microns so they apply consistently across grinders.
